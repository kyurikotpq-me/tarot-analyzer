# Tarot: Historical Analyzer
Given a set of files, with each file representing a tarot reading and containing information about the cards drawn, the scripts will do a simple aggregation of the different types of cards and present them in a visual format. 

The script will also display descriptions for "prevailing" type(s) of cards (i.e., the card type that appears the most often). Possible meanings for each card type are as follows:

| Card Type    | Meaning |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Upright      | xxx     |
| Reversed     | xxx     |
| Major Arcana | xxx     |
| Minor Arcana | xxx     |
| Cups         | xxx     |
| Pentacles    | xxx     |
| Suits        | xxx     |
| Wands        | xxx     |


## Using this repository
The `main` branch is your starting point. When you're done, check out the `answer` branch for my solution.

> Note that like Maths, there are a lot of ways to achieve the same outcome in programming, so don't fret if your work is very different (it should be!)

## Guides
If you're truly starting from scratch, here are the steps you need to follow:
1. Install Python 3.8+ (if not using MacOS)
2. Install a code editor software on your computer. I prefer using Visual Studio Code ("VS Code") - it's free works right out of the box
3. If you're using VS Code, I have recommended extensions to help you work faster :D

If you don't wanna watch the replay, I've summarised the process I have for approaching programming problems [here](wiki/programming-process.md). I've also summarised [best practices](wiki/best-practices.md) that have helped me focus more on programming instead of sweating the small stuff.

Both lists are not exhaustive, so feel free to experiment and create your own list :D
