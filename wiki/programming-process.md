# Programming Process
1. Understand the problem and intended outcome
2. Understand the data - its meaning, structure, and format. What properties and methods are there, if you need to put them in a class?
3. Using 1) and 2), form a plan of action 
   1. What steps do you need to take to get there? (pseudo-code)
   2. Of these steps, what do you not know (and have to Google?)
4. Keep calm and code, following your plan of action

> Plans can change; you might realize that you've missed a few steps in between, or forgot to account for certain scenarios. Don't fret, just course-correct and keep going!
